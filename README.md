=================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/realityforge/replicant-example.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/realityforge/replicant-example)

A sample application that demonstrates the use of the [replicant](https://github.com/realityforge/replicant) library.

TODO
====

* Allow poll to return a list of packets.
* Rework the graph Encode so that it can handle the scenario where the same object is encountered twice in graph traversal.
* create generic server-side subscription handler for all these top level components.
* Handle scenario where session goes away. Gracefully handle re-authentication etc.
* Document how this all works together!
