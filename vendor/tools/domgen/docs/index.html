<p>
  Domgen generates code from a <i>simple</i> domain model leaving the developer to focus on
  implementing high-value features of the application. The domain model is described using a
  domain specific language (DSL). Domgen then provides tasks that generate artifacts based on
  the domain model.
</p>

<p>
  i.e. A developer may define a persistent entity in the DSL. A task could then be used to
  generate zero or more of the following artifacts from the domain model.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The SQL Server sql or Postgres sql to define the associated database table, keys, constraints,
    indexes and triggers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ruby ActiveRecord definitions that define the columns, constraints and relationships.
  </li>
  <li>
    Java JPA entities that define fields for each attribute, constraints, relationships etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Java CDI beans that for querying and updating entities from and to the database.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This enables the user to get on with developing the application, and avoid focusing on the minutae
  of how to persist an entity to the database until there is a need. When the developer needs to customize
  how an entity is realized in the generated artifacts, the developer can annotate the domain model to
  guide the domgen generators.
</p>

<p>
  Domgen also allows the developer to define the service layer and application messaging.
</p>

<p>
  In summary Domgen consists of; <a href="model_elements.html">Model Elements</a> that define the types of
  things that domgen models, <a href="generators.html">Generators</a> that control generate artifacts from
  the model elements and <a href="facets.html">Facets</a> that allow customization of the generation process.
  The generation process is typically integrated with <a href="buildr_integration.html">Buildr</a>. Start
  with the <a href="getting_started.html">Getting Started</a> guide.
