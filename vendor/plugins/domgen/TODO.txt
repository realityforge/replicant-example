* Imit: Generate events for subscriptions starting and completing on the client side.
* JWS: Add ability to document wsdl
* Make it possible to define a model check that defines the dependency requirements
  between schemas. i.e. Entity can not be referenced by anyone. Template can reference
  Entity but not Overtimes etc.
* Support constants in relationship_constraints
* Fix xmi generation: fix existing enumeration/service generation, add message generation
* Introduce the "uses" metadata for service that can refer to entities (a.k.a DAOs) and other services. Use this to
  generate abstract service with required dependencies and update the uml generated.
* Add xor constraint
* Add state machine (based on rails gem or erlang library?)
* Figure out mechanism for declaring converters for jpa fields - derive from data type?
* Add converters to the list of classes in persistence unit
* Add ability to configure the set of classes in persistence unit. Can we also declare extra named/native queries there?
