* Imit: Generate events for subscriptions starting and completing on the client side.
* JWS: Add ability to document wsdl
* Generate documentation indicating the template groups, contained artifacts, facet list, facet configurations
  etc from metadata attached to code.
* When we define the artifacts in the model files, we should also be able to define the "template_group" and
  "artifact type" (ie, main/java vs test/java vs main/resources etc). This would allow us to remove the need
  for generator.rb files.
* Make it possible to define a model check that defines the dependency requirements
  between schemas. i.e. Entity can not be referenced by anyone. Template can reference
  Entity but not Overtimes etc.
* Support constants in relationship_constraints
* Fix xmi generation: fix existing enumeration/service generation, add message generation
* Introduce the "uses" metadata for service that can refer to entities (a.k.a DAOs) and other services. Use this to
  generate abstract service with required dependencies and update the uml generated.
* Add xor constraint
* Add state machine (based on rails gem or erlang library?)
* Add validation annotations; @NotNull, @Pattern, @Past
* Add unique constraints in jpa ala

* Use javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSeeAlso in inheritance hierarchies ala Exception/Entity
